# gRPC Communication using Rust

This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful gRPC-based sorting service. By leveraging the efficiency of gRPC for remote procedure calls, this service allows you to send an array of numbers to the server, which will then process the request and return the sorted array back to the client.
## Setup Instructions

1. Install Protocol Buffers Compiler:
   ```
   sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
   ```

2. Build the Project:
   ```
   cargo build
   ```

3. Run the Server:
   ```
   cargo run --bin server
   ```

4. Run the Client (in a separate terminal):
   ```
   cargo run --bin client
   ```

# How gRPC Communication Works: Simplified

## Define the Service:
You start by creating a .proto file where you describe your service (e.g., Sorting) and the types of messages it sends and receives (e.g., SortRequest and SortResponse).

## Generate Code:
The protoc compiler takes your .proto file and generates code for both the server and the client. This code handles the complexities of converting your messages to a format that can be sent over the network.

In Rust, you'll typically get:
- sorting_server.rs: Contains an abstract Sorting trait and a SortingServer helper.
- sorting_client.rs: Contains a SortingClient for making requests.

## Implement the Server:
You create a SortService struct in your Rust server code.

You implement the Sorting trait for your SortService, providing the actual logic for the sort function defined in your .proto file. This is where you'll put your sorting algorithm.

## Create the Server:
Use Tonic's tonic::transport::Server to build your gRPC server.

## Add Services:
Add your SortService to the server using the SortingServer wrapper generated by protoc. You can also add other services or features like server reflection here.

## Connect the Client:
In your client code, create a SortingClient and connect it to the server's address (e.g., http://[::1]:50051).
Use the client to send a SortRequest containing your array and receive the sorted array in a SortResponse.
